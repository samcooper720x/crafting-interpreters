# crafting-interpreters
Typescript implementation of a tree walk interpreter for the Lox programming language, as set out in _Crafting Interpreters_ by Robert Nystrom.
The book uses Java for it's implementation, but Typescript is chosen here for two reasons:
1. If I have to 'translate' the code I'll have to understand it better.
2. I'm supposed to be learning Typescript and this seemed like a fun way to do so!
